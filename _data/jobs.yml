        <li>Transforming the team from a reactive business intelligence function into a mature and proactive data science function, which works side-by-side with engineers and product managers across the business to embed ML into our products and services â€“ throughout the full ML lifecycle (experimentation, training, testing and cloud deployment).</li>
        <li>Designing and implementing Prezzee's financial reporting strategy, which uses dynamic statistical models to determine our cash flow and net margin from $2B of annual sales, as well as quantify and risk-weight $100M of customer deposit liabilities.</li>
        <li>Building an automated forecasting system that produces daily demand forecasts for thousands of products, which has so far saved over $150k in write-offs and stock-outs. In addition to designing the machine learning solution, I also developed all of the necessary infrastructure and orchestration within AWS using Terraform.</li>
        <li>Creating a first-party 'fraud lookup tool', which uses graph theory to connect customer personas across transactions and identify patterns in fraud activity. Fraud is a persistent challenge for many ecommerce businesses, and this fraud graph has allowed us to regularly block suspicious transactions, preventing many thousands of dollars of chargebacks.</li>
