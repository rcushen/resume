                Led the analytics and data science team at a fast-growing ecommerce startup. My focus was on building out the function's data science and machine learning capability, while solidifying the foundations of our analytics and business intelligence stack. Key accomplishments included:
                <ul>
                    <li>Transforming the team from a reactive business intelligence function into a mature and proactive data science function, which works side-by-side with engineers and product managers across the business to embed ML into our products and services â€“ throughout the full ML lifecycle (experimentation, training, testing and cloud deployment).</li>
                    <li>Designing and implementing Prezzee's financial reporting strategy, which uses dynamic statistical models to determine our cash flow and net margin from $2B of annual sales, as well as quantify and risk-weight $100M of customer deposit liabilities.</li>
                    <li>Building an automated forecasting system that produces daily demand forecasts for thousands of products, which has so far saved over $150k in write-offs and stock-outs. In addition to designing the machine learning solution, I also developed all of the necessary infrastructure and orchestration within AWS using Terraform.</li>
                    <li>Creating a first-party 'fraud lookup tool', which uses graph theory to connect customer personas across transactions and identify patterns in fraud activity. Fraud is a persistent challenge for many ecommerce businesses, and this fraud graph has allowed us to regularly block suspicious transactions, preventing many thousands of dollars of chargebacks.</li>
                    <li>My team recording the highest engagement and satisfaction scores across the entire business during our recent annual culture survey, which helped me successfully negotiate the retention of two junior analysts.</li>
                </ul>

            <dd>
                Whilst in London, I worked part-time as a maths and economics tutor, teaching group and one-on-one sessions with middle to secondary school students. These were run through schools, and ranged in scope from struggling GCSE students to high performing A-Level students. Responsibilities included lesson planning, generation of technical course notes, and coordination with teachers regarding learning strategies for specific students.

            <dd>
                During my time with Rio Tinto, I worked alongside the Economics & Markets team, assisting with the production of commodity price forecasts and testing out my understanding of industrial economics. This involved:
                <ul>
                    <li>Writing commodity research reports</li>

                    <li>An introduction to commodity forecasting methodologies</li>
                </ul>
                Key deliverables included an analysis of aluminium industry structure, presented to the group chief economist, and a review of global carbon prices as part of the carbon price forecast. Feedback noted a cogency and clarity of analysis, as well as a quick ability to apply key economic concepts.
